# Bulk Invoice Upload System

## Problem Statement

ClearTax wants a bulk invoice upload (CSV) feature that processes uploaded invoices in the background and displays real-time progress. Processed invoices should appear in a scrollable table with Match / Mismatch status. If one invoice fails during processing, remaining invoices should continue processing. Row-level errors should be visible to the user.

# 2. What Problem Are We Solving?

Currently, users may need to upload invoices one by one.

This is slow, repetitive, and inefficient.

Our system allows users to upload thousands of invoices through a CSV file and process them automatically in the background while displaying live progress.
